# speech-classifier


## Notes

- audio cleaning
- detect non-speech vs speech
- can keras be useful for audio classification?
- spectra into random forest or other (un)supervised classifier?
- frequencies vs amplitudes - which is better?
- envelope fingerprinting or phonemes
- time autocorrelations or cross-correlations?
- cluster analysis to identify groups of speakers
  - identify what makes clusters fail
